# **Chess Defense Game**

### **Overview**

A unique twist on the classic chessboard, where you control pieces to defend designated squares against waves of enemies. This game blends chess mechanics with tower defense strategy, challenging players to outmaneuver opponents and protect key points as the board expands and new enemies emerge.

---

### **Features (In Progress)**

- **Chessboard Defense Mechanic**: Control chess pieces with their traditional moves to defend specific squares.
- **Wave-based Enemy Spawning**: Enemies spawn and attack in waves, increasing in frequency and difficulty.
- **Knight Central Mechanic**: Start with a knight in the middle, defending squares while facing incoming enemies.
- **Enemy Movement**: Enemies move like kings, aiming to reach the protected squares.
- **Upgrades and Purchases**: Gain points by defeating enemies, and use them to buy additional defending pieces like knights, queens, and kings.
- **Board Expansion**: The board expands with each wave, increasing in size and complexity.
- **Obstacles and Barriers**: Block certain areas with barriers or immovable obstacles, strategically positioning them each wave.
- **Tower Defense Influence**: Strategically place defensive blocks (maximum 1 per wave) that can‚Äôt be connected to others but block enemy movement, but it will also block your own! (Except your trusty knight of course).
